#### MNIST dataset

Our dataset contains 2000 MNIST images as training data and 500 MNIST images as testing data. All the images are high resolution (28 x 28) with corresponding labels ranging from 0 to 9, and were designed to test classification algorithms.

### Image Classification with CNN network

* Load MNIST data set

* Preprocessing data:  
	a. Data Normalization.   
	b. Transform data into PyTorch tensor.
	
* Build CNN network:  
	a. Define hyperparameters.  
	b. Define your optimizer and loss function(criterion)

* Plot learning curve
